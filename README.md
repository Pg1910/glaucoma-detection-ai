Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, often progressing asymptomatically until late stages. Accurate early detection is thus vital. Existing automated systems typically rely on either global image-based classifiers or optic disc/cup segmentation pipelines, each with limited robustness across datasets. In this work, we propose GlaucFusion, a dualbranch vision transformer framework for segmentation-aware
glaucoma diagnosis. Our architecture combines two complementary pathways: (1) an Encoder-Only Mask Transformer (EOMT) that leverages OD/OC segmentation masks alongside fundus images, and (2) a domain-adaptive DINOv2-ViT-S/14 branch with dataset-specific classifiers. A novel Laplacian variance filter discards low-quality inputs, and a dataset classification module maps inputs to their source domain. We introduce a dynamic
confidence-weighted fusion module that combines predictions from both branches based on their proximity to the decision boundary. GlaucFusion achieves strong generalization on four benchmark datasets—Drishti-GS, REFUGE, HYGD, and AIROGS-Light—with peak accuracy of 96.55% on REFUGE and
robust performance on smaller datasets. Our results demonstrate that fusing segmentation-aware and global representations offers significant improvements in generalizability and interpretability for glaucoma detection.
